# FollowDiff

Chrome extension that tracks Instagram follower changes.

Unlike other sites that make you download your Instagram data and upload it, FollowDiff works with one click. No data exports, no file uploads.

## What it does

- One-click snapshot of any profile's followers/following
- Compare snapshots to see who followed or unfollowed
- Export data as JSON or plain text
- Track multiple profiles

## Privacy

All data stays in your browser. No servers, no accounts, no tracking. Fully open source.

## Install

[Add to Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aaceanoaafnpeenehkddbmmjlhgeodkd)
